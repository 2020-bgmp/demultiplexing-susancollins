>**Quality Score Cutoff: 30**
>
>For each index in an index pair, an average quality score of at least 30 was required in order to be binned in the matched or hopped read files.
>This high cutoff was used to ensure 99.9% accuracy in the index base calls, allowing for high confidence in the identification of reads in downstream analysis.
>The low quality bin can easily undergo further parsing/error correction if more reads are required.
