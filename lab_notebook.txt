-index file:
    /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/indexes.txt
-created test files with 16 lines each for the read fastq files
-can be found here:
    /projects/bgmp/scollin3/bioinformatics/Bi622

-figured out that indexes supplied are rev comp... so read2 = index list and read3 must be converted
-note: unknown/low quality includes all reads with one or two unknown/low quality

- ran slurm script to make histogram from first index file..found out that the script was trying to save my figure to the wrong location
- altered base_dist.sh script to include output file name as an argument

- testing out how to find number of indexes containing N 
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -e "N" | wc -l

-added a list of all open matched output files so that I can easily close them all at the end
-note to self: think about how to structure permutation dictionary, currently will only work if I flip indexes in the header lines to 
both be in the same direction
- chose not to use, but in case I need to go back:
        #for row in itertools.zip(r1, r2, i1, i2):
        #line_r1 = row[0].strip()
        #line_r2 = row[1].strip()
        #line_i1 = row[2].strip()
        #line_i2 = row[3].strip()
-researched how to use itertools.islice and incorporated into code to break file into chucks of 4 lines aka records
- TO Fix: still getting an extra empty list at the end of the records...not sure how to fix yet
- IMPORTANT: need to add in gzip once using real files
- TO ADD: would like to add functionality to convertphred function to find average score and use boolean if score is above or below cutoff value

- found the number of records in the r2 file:
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | grep -e "^@" | wc -l
        363246735
- realized that the extra empty list was causing an error that prohibited my files from closing at the end of the sort_indexes function
- would like to find a better way to solve this problem later... for now I added an argparse argument for number of records in the file
- changed permutations dictionary to include forward and reverse index pairs
- started slurm script to run overnight

- script took 9 hours just to do the file parsing....woah....something's not right...
- it finished parsing and began zipping before it was cancelled for hitting 10h time limit
- now I am zipping the rest of the files in an interactive session on Talapas

- editing test script to add more stats information and will rerun real script after testing of new features
- also believe permuations dictionary was not counting.. fixed in test file
- decided to flip second index to be rev comp of index 1 to make permutations dictionary smaller
- sorted permutations file:
    cat permutations.tsv | (sed -u 1q; sort -k2 -n -r) > sorted_permutations.tsv

- time for second run:
